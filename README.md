CS 1440 Assignment 0: Demo Project

This file is your playground.  Do with it as you see fit.

The files in the instructions/ directory will be useful to you.  Do not change these files; that may cause problems in the event the instructor needs to send out corrections.

[The requirements of the assignment](./instructions/README.md)

[Introduction to the Markdown markup language](./instructions/Markdown.md)

Documentation that you write belongs in the doc/ directory.  Do not move those files from that location!  You will not receive credit if your grader cannot easily find them.
